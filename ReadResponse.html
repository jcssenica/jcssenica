    <h1>Response to Critical Atlas of the Internet</h1>

      Louise Durlhe’s Critical Atlas of the Internet is crafted and delivered
      beautifully and poetically with written words and digital website layouts.
      I really enjoyed this type of delivery of text and the flow it creates.

      I am most attracted and inspired by the word Architecture: “Internet
      architecture is controlled by search engines,” “There are many Internet
      architectures as there are users.” Never have I thought about comparing
      the internet to architecture, however, it is an effective metaphor that
      shows the building, the development, and endless progressing traits of the
      internet. This website strengthened my idea of the structure of the
      internet, knowing that there are a “base”, “layers (hidden layers)”,
      “branches”, “individual users” to form the internet, just like in
      architecture there are fundamental structures, levels of buildings,
      elevators and platforms, and individual units or cells. “Internet is a
      mirror reflecting our terrestrial position” This sentence is so poetic and
      I loved it. In the earthspace, people are distinctively, purposefully, and
      being controlled in areas that are fenced by multiple reasons, regionally,
      socially, and politically. As described in the article/the website, the
      internet is also structured like geographical settlements. However, as the
      “Search engines continually organize and reorganize the web”, the
      separations, connections, and placements of the web structure became
      ambiguous and the human space placements can hardly be compared with it.
      As much as this quote sounds natural, it also implies that human are using
      their powers to modify the organization of the web in both positive and
      negative ways. This ambiguous quote leads to another quote, "In order to
      exist, cyberspace needs equipment and a concrete infrastructure in
      terrestrial space. With this physical equipment, the Internet and
      cyberspace remain solidly anchored in geographical space. The Internet is
      a virtual network built into physical reality. It’s a cloud that puts down
      roots into concrete." It is interesting to think about how humans and the
      algorithm are interplaying in this building of the internet, with
      intentional and unintentional purposes.

      “The difference between earthspace and cyberspace: On Earth, people move
      towards their centers of interest; on the Internet, we are at the center
      and the space is created around us”<br />
      How far away is specific information from where I am on the internet? For
      instance, how far away is news about the stock market away from me as a
      user of the search engine who typically, merely searches anything about
      design, fashion, or shopping sites. Maybe I will encounter it after a
      thousand times of searching? Maybe a million times of searching? It’s
      frightening to think that the information could be right beside you (right
      beside the thing you searched for on the search engine), but you could
      never come across it because of the algorithm and this user-centered
      design aspect. Following this logic, the internet brings people apart
      rather than shortening the distance between individuals, since every
      search engine user will stay in their own bubble created by their own
      interest with the help of the internet. But is it really encouraged? One
      of the goals of developing technology and the internet is to bring people
      closer and make this traveling of digital and physical distance easier.
      However, with this personalized algorithm and user-centered experience
      design, I resonate with people who are getting lonelier on the internet.

      The question I have is about the part where Louise Durlhe writes about
      OSI, TCP/IP models.
