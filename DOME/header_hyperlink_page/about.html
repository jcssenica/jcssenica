          The DOME consists a reconstructed nature that hints to a speculative
          <br />
          environment in the near future that derived from the vision of the
          <br />
          producer and world building project. Taking place in a dome, audience
          <br />
          will find a reimagined tropical forests with gloomy, dimmed atmosphere
          <br />
          and humid climate. On the contrary, transparent, and chrome materials
          <br />
          are used to create surreal objects to emphasize a dreamy illusion.
          This <br />
          project hopes to illustrate an environment that invites the audience
          to <br />
          roam within the dark and bright and get inspired by the unique <br />
          perspective and imagination.<br />
